# Provata Health HIPAA Docs

The Provata Health HIPAA Docs exist to outline the ways Provata Health complies with HIPAA. These docs have been open sourced by [Catalyze Inc.](https://catalyze.io) in order to help the health IT community grow and improve patient care through secure, usable software.

# Getting Started

The Provata Health HIPAA docs are built using [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), a static site generator. Please follow the [installation instructions](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/) for Middleman before continuing.

Once you have Middleman installed and working you can complete the following to get a working copy of these docs on your local machine:

- `git clone https://github.com/ProvataHealth/HIPAA.git`
- `cd HIPAA`
- `bundle install`

**Commands:**

- `rake build` generates the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- `rake run` allows you to view the site locally
- `rake sass` compiles styles changes
- `rake serve_static` runs a simple web server in the build directory
